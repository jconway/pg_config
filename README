Build like any other contrib. I.e. either:
 - untar in contrib folder of postgres source tree and do "make", "make install"
or
 - untar somewhere and do "USE_PGXS=1 make", "USE_PGXS=1 make install"

Currently only supports PostgreSQL 9.0 alpha.

Example:

select * from unnest((select string_to_array(trim( both '''' from setting), ''' ''') from pg_config where name='CONFIGURE'));
                           unnest
